= Secrets Management

== Content

Implementing opensource secrets management using RedHat and cloud provider solutions:

=== External Secrets Operator

* **Installation**: Deploy External Secrets Operator from OperatorHub for cloud-native secrets management
* **Provider Configuration**: Configure SecretStore resources for different secret backends (AWS, Azure, GCP, Vault)
* **ExternalSecret Resources**: Create ExternalSecret custom resources to sync secrets from external sources
* **Refresh Policies**: Configure automatic secret refresh intervals and sync policies
* **Multi-cluster Support**: Manage secrets across multiple OpenShift clusters using cluster-scoped stores

=== HashiCorp Vault Integration

* **Vault Deployment**: Deploy Vault on OpenShift using the Vault Operator or Helm charts
* **Authentication Methods**: Configure Kubernetes authentication and service account token authentication
* **Secret Engines**: Set up KV, database, PKI, and transit secret engines for different use cases
* **Dynamic Secrets**: Implement dynamic database credentials and short-lived certificates
* **Policy Management**: Create and manage Vault policies for fine-grained access control

=== Cloud Provider Integration

* **AWS Secrets Manager**: Integrate with AWS Secrets Manager using IAM roles and External Secrets Operator
* **Azure Key Vault**: Connect to Azure Key Vault using managed identities and workload identity
* **Google Secret Manager**: Integrate with Google Secret Manager using workload identity and service accounts
* **Cross-cloud Support**: Manage secrets across multiple cloud providers in hybrid deployments
* **Regional Replication**: Configure secret replication for disaster recovery and high availability

=== Secret Lifecycle Management

* **Secret Rotation**: Implement automated secret rotation using external secret management systems
* **Version Control**: Manage secret versions and implement rollback procedures for secret updates
* **Expiration Policies**: Set up secret expiration and renewal workflows
* **Auditing**: Enable comprehensive auditing of secret access and modifications
* **Cleanup Procedures**: Implement procedures for removing unused or expired secrets

=== Application Integration

* **CSI Secret Store Driver**: Use Secrets Store CSI driver to mount secrets as volumes in pods
* **Environment Variables**: Securely inject secrets as environment variables using External Secrets
* **Init Containers**: Use init containers to fetch and prepare secrets before application startup
* **Sidecar Patterns**: Implement sidecar containers for continuous secret refresh and management
* **SDK Integration**: Integrate application SDKs with secret management providers for runtime access
