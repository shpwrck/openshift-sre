Installing and managing OpenShift GitOps for declarative cluster and application management:

=== OpenShift GitOps Installation

* **Operator Installation**: Install OpenShift GitOps Operator from OperatorHub or via CLI
* **Instance Configuration**: Configure ArgoCD instances for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
* **Resource Sizing**: Size ArgoCD components based on repository count and sync frequency requirements
* **High Availability**: Configure ArgoCD for high availability in production environments
* **Namespace Management**: Set up appropriate namespaces and RBAC for GitOps operations

=== ArgoCD Configuration Management

* **Repository Integration**: Connect ArgoCD to Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)
* **Cluster Registration**: Register additional OpenShift clusters as ArgoCD deployment targets
* **Application Projects**: Configure ArgoCD projects to organize and isolate applications
* **RBAC Configuration**: Set up role-based access control for different teams and environments
* **SSO Integration**: Integrate ArgoCD with OpenShift OAuth or external identity providers

=== Application Lifecycle Management

* **Application Definitions**: Create and manage ArgoCD Application custom resources
* **Sync Policies**: Configure automatic vs manual sync policies and sync windows
* **Health Checks**: Define custom health checks for application resources
* **Rollback Procedures**: Implement rollback strategies for failed deployments
* **Multi-cluster Deployments**: Manage applications across multiple OpenShift clusters

=== GitOps Workflow Implementation

* **Repository Structure**: Establish standardized Git repository structures for infrastructure and applications
* **Branching Strategy**: Implement GitOps-friendly branching strategies (GitFlow, trunk-based, etc.)
* **Promotion Workflows**: Set up automated promotion workflows between environments
* **Secret Management**: Integrate external secret management solutions (Vault, External Secrets Operator)
* **Configuration Management**: Manage environment-specific configurations using Kustomize or Helm

=== Monitoring and Observability

* **ArgoCD Metrics**: Monitor ArgoCD performance, sync status, and application health
* **Sync Monitoring**: Track application sync frequency, duration, and success rates
* **Drift Detection**: Monitor and alert on configuration drift between Git and cluster state
* **Audit Logging**: Enable comprehensive audit logging for GitOps operations
* **Notification Setup**: Configure notifications for sync failures, drift detection, and deployment events

=== Security and Compliance

* **Git Repository Security**: Implement secure Git repository access using SSH keys or tokens
* **Image Security**: Integrate image scanning and security policies into GitOps workflows
* **Policy Enforcement**: Use Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper for policy-as-code enforcement
* **Compliance Scanning**: Integrate compliance tools into GitOps deployment pipelines
* **Access Controls**: Implement least-privilege access for GitOps service accounts and users

=== Disaster Recovery and Backup

* **ArgoCD Backup**: Implement backup strategies for ArgoCD configuration and application definitions
* **Repository Backup**: Ensure Git repository backup and disaster recovery procedures
* **Cluster Recovery**: Establish cluster recovery procedures using GitOps for rapid restoration
* **State Reconstruction**: Implement procedures to reconstruct cluster state from Git repositories
* **Testing Recovery**: Regularly test disaster recovery procedures in non-production environments
