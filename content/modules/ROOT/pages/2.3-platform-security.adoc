Implementing Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (RHACS) for comprehensive OpenShift security:

=== RHACS Installation and Setup

* **Operator Installation**: Deploy RHACS Operator from OperatorHub to manage security components
* **Central Services**: Install and configure RHACS Central for centralized security management
* **Secured Cluster**: Deploy Secured Cluster components (Sensor, Collector, Admission Controller)
* **Scanner Integration**: Configure image vulnerability scanning with integrated or external scanners
* **Initial Configuration**: Set up basic security policies, notifications, and user access

=== Image Security and Vulnerability Management

* **Image Scanning**: Automatic scanning of container images for vulnerabilities and policy violations
* **Registry Integration**: Connect to container registries (Quay, Docker Hub, AWS ECR, etc.) for scanning
* **Vulnerability Assessment**: Analyze CVE data, CVSS scores, and exploitability information
* **Policy Enforcement**: Create and enforce image security policies based on vulnerability severity
* **Scan Results Management**: Review, acknowledge, and track remediation of security findings

=== Runtime Security Monitoring

* **Behavioral Analysis**: Monitor runtime behavior and detect anomalous activity
* **Network Monitoring**: Track network connections and identify suspicious communication patterns
* **Process Monitoring**: Monitor process execution and detect unauthorized or malicious processes
* **File System Monitoring**: Track file system changes and detect potential security breaches
* **Incident Response**: Investigate security incidents and implement response procedures

=== Compliance and Risk Management

* **Compliance Standards**: Assess compliance against standards (CIS, NIST, PCI DSS, SOC2)
* **Risk Assessment**: Perform continuous risk assessment of cluster security posture
* **Security Reports**: Generate compliance reports and security dashboards for stakeholders
* **Remediation Guidance**: Provide actionable remediation steps for security findings
* **Audit Trails**: Maintain comprehensive audit logs for security events and policy changes
