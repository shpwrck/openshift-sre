= Cluster Operations

== Content

Core cluster lifecycle operations that SREs manage:

=== Cluster Updates

* **Update Planning**: Plan OpenShift cluster updates including scheduling, testing, and rollback strategies
* **Pre-update Validation**: Verify cluster health, node readiness, and workload compatibility before updates
* **Rolling Updates**: Execute cluster updates using machine config pools and staged rollouts
* **Update Channels**: Manage update channels (stable, fast, candidate) and version targeting
* **Post-update Verification**: Validate cluster functionality and workload health after updates
* **Update Rollbacks**: Execute rollback procedures when updates fail or cause issues

=== Node Addition and Removal

* **Node Scaling**: Add worker nodes to increase cluster capacity based on resource demands
* **Infrastructure Nodes**: Add dedicated infrastructure nodes for OpenShift components (registry, monitoring, logging)
* **Node Draining**: Safely drain nodes before removal to migrate workloads without disruption
* **Node Cordoning**: Cordon nodes to prevent new pod scheduling during maintenance or removal
* **Machine Sets**: Manage machine sets to automate node provisioning and replacement
* **Node Decommissioning**: Properly remove nodes from the cluster and clean up associated resources

=== Node Image Management

* **Operating System Updates**: Apply RHEL CoreOS updates through machine config operators
* **Base Image Rotation**: Manage base node image updates and security patches
* **Machine Config Pools**: Configure and manage machine config pools for different node types
* **Image Validation**: Test new node images in development before production deployment
* **Rollback Procedures**: Maintain ability to rollback to previous node images when issues occur
* **Custom Machine Configs**: Create and manage custom machine configurations for specific requirements

=== Device Management

* **GPU Resources**: Configure and manage GPU nodes using NVIDIA GPU Operator or AMD GPU drivers
* **Device Plugins**: Deploy and maintain Kubernetes device plugins for specialized hardware
* **Network Interfaces**: Manage SR-IOV network devices and high-performance networking configurations
* **Resource Allocation**: Configure device resource limits and scheduling for GPU/FPGA workloads
* **Driver Management**: Maintain device drivers through machine configs and operator deployments
* **Device Monitoring**: Monitor device utilization, temperature, and health status across nodes
* **Hardware Compatibility**: Validate hardware compatibility and manage device firmware updates
