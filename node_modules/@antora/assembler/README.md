# Antora Assembler

A library for merging the AsciiDoc from multiple pages into a single document (i.e., an assembly) and converting that document to another format such as PDF.

Assembler works by constructing AsciiDoc documents from multiple pages using the navigation as a model.
It then delegates to a converter (typically an external command) provided by an exporter extension to convert those assembly documents to an export format such as PDF.
Finally, it publishes those exports along with the other files in the site.
The exports can then be viewed offline, either by the browser or a reader application.

[Antora](https://antora.org) is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
The Assembler extends the feature set of Antora by providing the foundation for page aggregation.
