# Antora PDF Extension

The Antora PDF extension is an exporter extension for Assembler that assembles and converts content to the PDF format using Asciidoctor PDF.
The Antora PDF extension is the official extension for exporting content in an Antora site to PDF.

This extension is based on Antora Assembler.
It provides the converter function and metadata that Assembler uses to export content.
Assembler constructs assembly AsciiDoc documents from pages per component version using the navigation as a model.
Using the converter provided by this extension, it then iterates over those assembly documents and converts them to PDF using Asciidoctor PDF (or the specified command).
Finally, it adds those PDFs to the content catalog as exports, which Antora then publishes alongside the other files in the site.

## Usage

Once this package is installed in the playbook project, register it in the Antora playbook as follows:

**antora-playbook.yml**

```yaml
antora:
  extensions:
  - '@antora/pdf-extension'
# ...
```

You can configure the behavior of the extension using the optional _antora-assembler.yml_ file.
